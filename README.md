I was tasked too repair a broken website and make it look similiar to the demo provided.
I learned a bit into how CSS impacts html for example, I was trying to force the meeting image into
the html and kept adjusting the size to make it fit but I kept getting a big white gap. Just to see
there was an aleardy made code on CSS where it fits flush without the gaps and having to adjust the size.
